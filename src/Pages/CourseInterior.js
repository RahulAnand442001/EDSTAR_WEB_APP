                                category we commonly refer to as insights. Insights are beyond news or
                                information that is processed. E.g.:- Why it happened, what next, what changes,
                                how and when will the change happen, etc. Insights give you a heads up over the
                                rest. When you subscribe to EDSTAR, along with its other key benefits, you are
                                basically paying a nominal price to access these insights before others do. It
                                is a small price to pay to stay better and informed and ahead of the rest.
